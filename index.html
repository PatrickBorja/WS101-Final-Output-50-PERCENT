                            I'm Patrick Borja, a BSIT student who finds fulfillment in the simple joys of life. <br>
                            With a humble approach to learning and a genuine curiosity for knowledge, 
                            I strive to contribute positively to the world. <br> In my journey, I embrace the lessons each experience offers, 
                            fostering a mindset of continuous growth and gratitude. <br> I look forward to connecting with others and sharing 
                            in the collective beauty of life.</p>

                        <p>
                            I finished my Senior High School on my very hometown. It taught me most things I know today. <br>
                            But learning doesn't stop at one point, in one zone. It's one thing I learned in my school that <br>
                            you shouldn't stay at one places. There's so many places to learn, more things to learn.
